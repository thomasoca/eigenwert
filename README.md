A 2D platformer game created with Godot game engine as my first attempt to trying out game development. Most of the game arts are free stuff from itch.io by Szadi art. 
My final goal is to create a simple single-level playlable games as a proof-of-concept of my game development.

## Work in progress
- [ ] Add checkpoint mechanism
- [ ] More fluid combat mechanics
- [ ] Stamina bar
- [x] ~~There is a bug that the enemy will wrap up towards the player if the gravity is activated, still works on that~~
- [ ] Interaction UI (kinda works)
